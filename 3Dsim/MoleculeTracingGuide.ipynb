The multiplier defaults to unity, and the reference value of the cross section is set at $\\sigma_{ref}=20\\cdot\\sigma_{He-He}$, i.e. 20 times the helium-helium cross section.\n",
    "\n",

In other words, if this flag is set to `False` the molecule position will be recorded at _every_ time-step, resulting in a much larger output file. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`INIT_COND`**: (int) this parameter encodes the type of (pre-defined) initial conditions we would like to set for our molecules. The initial conditions might encode e.g. the region in the cell where the molecules are to start out, and the initial velocity distribution. These are hard-coded in the `ParticleTracing.initial_species_position()` and `ParticleTracing.initial_species_velocity()` methods. \n",

Currently defaults to `0`, indicating that an unbiased, \"uncorrected\" Maxwell-Boltzmann thermal distribution is used (this is the simplest/fastest distribution to draw from). If instead `CORRECTION=1` then the velocity distribution PDF has an \"extra\" factor of $v$ to account for the speed-dependence of the collision probability (see the reference document).  This dependence is hard-coded in `ParticleTracing.get_ambient_velocity()`."
